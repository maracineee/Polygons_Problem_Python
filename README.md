# Polygons_Problem_Python
4) Design and implement a module for polygons. The module must allow to solve the following problems related to polygons: - Creating of a polygon; - Printing of a polygon; - Determining the rectangle with a minimum area, which contains inside the polygon; - Determining the area of a polygon; - Determining the perimeter of a polygon; - Determining the gravity center; - Determining if the polygon is convex; - Comparison of polygons according to their area; - Concatenation of two polygons; the concatenation of two polygons is a convex polygon obtained as following: - Determines the reunion of the two sets containing the vertices of the two polygons; - Determines the convex-hull of the set of vertices above determined; - The vertices of the convex-hull represent the vertices of the new polygon;
